# Nordic-PPK2-USB_C-Adapter
USB-C adapter for [Nordic's Power Profiler Kit II](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Power-Profiler-Kit-2). Ideal for easily measuring the current drawn by a device/board.

## Enclosure
The enclosure can be printed using regular PLA. An infill of 100% is recommended.

After mounting the PCB in the enclosure, use a hot flat object (e.g. an iron) to melt the plastic 'pins'. This will lock the PCB in place.
